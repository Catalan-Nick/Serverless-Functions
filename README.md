# Up and Running with Serverless Functions 

## HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap 5

Serverless functions open a world of possibilities for running on-demand, server-side code without having to run a dedicated server.<br>
Serverless functions, branded as Netlify Functions when running on Netlify, are a way to deploy server-side code as API endpoints. These will spin up automatically when triggered by an event, handle and process server ran code, and then spin down until the next event.
